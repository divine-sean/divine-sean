ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sean, and I am 16 years old.

I've been coding for a while, but I've never taken time to actually learn. I want to change this - so I'll (try) be active on github.

### About Me
I've been interested in computer science for a while now.

### Topics I'm Learning
- Hopefully stuff

Please - give me recommendations on what to learn. I'm willing to do anything.
