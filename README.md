- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sean, and I am 15 years old.
-  I've been coding for a while, but I've never taken time to actually learn.
-  On the 8th of july, I would have started my learning journey.
-  I've been interested in computing science for a while now.
-  I will document my learning process. Which will contain what I'm doing, and my learning resources.
- This will contain HTML and CSS, javascript, API's, backend development, advanced web design, version control with git, frontend frameworks with react, backend basics with node.js and express, databases with MongoDB, full stack development and system programming, C++, assembly, operating system basics, and finally: my final project.

Seems ambitious for a 15 year old, huh? Well, I've not been learning for a while and I finally just want to get out of my shell and learn SOMETHING. Even if I don't learn it all, atleast I learned something. I'm putting this here so I'm motivated to keep on going, and won't give up, as you guys are watching me throughout my learning journey, haha.
