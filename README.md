# My Learning Journey

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sean, and I am 15 years old.

I've been coding for a while, but I've never taken time to actually learn. On July 8th, I started my official learning journey.

### About Me
I've been interested in computer science for a while now. I will document my learning process here, which will include what I'm learning and the resources I'm using.

### Topics I'm Learning
- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript
- APIs
- Backend development
- Advanced web design
- Version control with Git
- Frontend frameworks with React
- Backend basics with Node.js and Express
- Databases with MongoDB
- Full stack development and system programming
- C++
- Assembly
- Operating system basics
- Final project

Seems ambitious for a 15-year-old, huh? Well, I've not been learning for a while, and I finally just want to get out of my shell and learn SOMETHING. Even if I don't learn it all, at least I learned something. I'm putting this here so I'm motivated to keep on going and won't give up, as you guys are watching me throughout my learning journey, haha.
